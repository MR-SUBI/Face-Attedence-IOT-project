<h1>Camera Attendance System<h1>
  
<p>Welcome to the Camera Attendance System repository! 📷💻<p>

<h1>Overview<h1>
  
<p>This project is all about simplifying attendance tracking using cameras and the power of Internet of Things (IoT). We've employed Python, OpenCV, and Flask to create an efficient system that not only accurately recognizes faces but also integrates seamlessly into a user-friendly web interface.<p>

<h1>Technology Stack<h1>
<p>Python: The backbone of our system, providing flexibility and reliability.<p>
<p>OpenCV: Enables advanced image processing for precise facial recognition.<p>
<p>Flask: Creates a smooth web interface for easy access.<p>

<h1>Hardware Components<h1>
<p>ESP32 Cam: A high-performance camera used for image capture and processing.<p>
<p>2102 USB to TTL Module: Enhances communication between various hardware components.<p>

<h1>Getting Started<h1>
<p>To get started with the Camera Attendance System, follow these steps:<p>

Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```
Install Dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Application:
```
python main.py
```
<p>Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000 to start using the system.<p>

Happy coding! 🚀🌐
